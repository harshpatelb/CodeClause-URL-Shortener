# URL Shortener Project

This repository hosts the captivating creation resulting from the Python Development Internship provided by Code Clause. The heart of this project beats with the purpose of crafting a simplistic yet dazzling URL shortener, brought to life using the `pyshorteners` library. Dive into the magic as we transform long, cumbersome URLs into sleek and chic links ready to be shared effortlessly.

## Getting Started

Begin your journey with the URL shortener by following these enchanting steps:

1. **Initiate the Connection** ‚ú®

   Clone this repository to your realm of coding wonder:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshpatelb/CodeClause-URL-Shortener.git
   ```

2. **Summon the Potions** üßô

   Conjure the necessary magical ingredients with the incantation of your command:

   ```bash
   pip install pyshorteners
   ```

3. **Cast the Spell** ü™Ñ

   Harness the power of Python to cast the spell of URL shortening:

   ```bash
   python shorten_url.py
   ```

4. **Whisper the Incantation** üìú

   Utter the original URL you wish to bestow with brevity.

5. **Witness the Magic** ‚ú®

   Behold the transformation as the script unveils the original and shortened URLs, elegantly presented for your gaze.

## How It Works

The URL shortener project gracefully wields the `pyshorteners` library, which serves as a conduit to the mystical TinyURL service. Within the script, the `shorten_url(url)` spell receives a lengthy URL, channeling its essence through the arcane paths of TinyURL, and returning a compact manifestation.

Once you've spoken your desires, the script graces your eyes with both the original and shortened URLs, each elegantly adorned to provide a delightful user experience.

## Project Structure

Within this repository, you'll uncover these enchanting artifacts:

- `shorten_url.py`: The heart of the operation, where the magic of URL shortening and user interaction harmoniously dance.
- `README.md`: The scroll of knowledge you're currently perusing, guiding you through the intricacies of this magical endeavor.
- `LICENSE`: A testament to the project's spirit of openness and sharing.

## Future Enchantments

While the current iteration of this magical creation boasts simplicity, the cauldron of creativity remains ever-stirring:

- Infuse support for an array of URL shortening enchanters, granting users the freedom to choose their preferred magic.
- Weave a web-based tapestry, transforming this script into an online spellbook accessible through the digital ether.
- Craft the shield of error-handling spells, ensuring grace when URLs resist the allure of shortening.
- For those with a daring spirit, forge a mystical database to chronicle the history of transformed URLs.

Venture forth, valiant contributor, and add your own magical incantations to the spellbook of URL shortening!
